# **Embed to Link** [Firefox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-embed-to-link-url/)    
Replaces video site (YT, Vimeo) embeds (iframe, object, embed types) with clickable URLs to those videos instead

Currently only works on YT and Vimeo embeds 
Currently no options/toggles are provided, must disable add-on to toggle it off

Extension based on the following MIT licensed [userscript by eight04](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/1590-no-embed-youtube)

Slight code updates made to detect additional embeds. 
Note: *NO generative AI tools used in code creation or editing*

No roadmap for additional features at this point, but as time allows, may add functionality.

The single permission (Access your data for all websites) is only so that the code can narrowly perform its specific actions, which is that, when a page loads, it will run through the content of the page, locate embeds, and replace them. It does not look at, transmit, or otherwise touch, track, or log any user data.
